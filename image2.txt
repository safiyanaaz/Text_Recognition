"I've learned that no matter what happens, or
how bad it seems today, life does go on, and it
will be better tomorrow. I've learned that you
can tell a lot about a person by the way he/she
handles these three things: a rainy day, lost
luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights. I've
learned that regardless of your relationship
with your parents, you'll miss them when
they're gone from your life. I've learned that
making a "living" is not the same thing as
making a "life." I've learned that life sometimes
gives you a second chance. I've learned that you
shouldn't go through life with a catcher's mitt
on both hands; you need to be able to throw
something back. I've learned that whenever I
decide something with an open heart, I usually
make the right decision. I've learned that even
when I have pains, I don't have to be one. I've
learned that every day you should reach out and
touch someone. People love a warm hug, or just
a friendly pat on the back. I've learned that I
still have a lot to learn, I've learned that people
will forget what you said, people will forget
what you did, but people will never forget how
you made them feel."
