"Stop apologising. You don't have to say
sorry for how you laugh, how you dress,
how you make your hair, how you do your
makeup, how you speak. You don't have to
be sorry for being yourself. Do it
fearlessly. It's time to accept: this is you,
and you gotta spend the rest of your life
with you. So start loving your sarcasm,
your awkwardness, your weird habits,
your unique sense of humour, your voice,
your talents, your everything. It will make
your life so much easier."
