Sometimes you just have to turn
the page to realize there is more
to your book of life than
the page you're stuck on.
Stop being afraid to move on.
Close this chapter of hurt,
and never re-read it again.
It's time to get what your life
deserves, and move on from the
things that don't deserve you.
Don't spend your days trying to
correct your past, instead, let go
and let God create something
better for your future.
